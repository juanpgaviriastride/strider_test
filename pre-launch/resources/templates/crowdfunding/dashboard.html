                    <b>Please read these Terms & Conditions carefully. They govern your relationship with Webtalk as a participant in the Company’s crowdfunding campaign (the “campaign”). Your participation in this campaign is entirely voluntary on your part to assist Webtalk in obtaining the necessary funds to successfully launch its business, and you understand and agree that the campaign may fail to reach its goals. You further understand and acknowledge that the only benefit that you will receive as a participant in the campaign is the award of credits for the future purchase of Webtalk products and services. You acknowledge that the campaign is NOT securities-based crowdfunding and that you will not receive any equity or other ownership interest in the company. The campaign is a contribution crowdfunding program.</b>
                  </p>
                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Crowdfunding</h2>
                  <p>Webtalk's crowdfunding campaign is intended to solicit contributions from the general public to acquire pre-sales of Webtalk Credits that will be valid towards the purchase of any premium Webtalk service offering upon launch. The sales revenue acquired will be used to demonstrate wide-spread interest in the Webtalk products and services to venture capitalists in an effort to assist in raising the funds Webtalk needs to sustain operations after launch. The cost for Webtalk to efficiently conduct business and provide a quality service exceeds two million dollars ($2,000,000) per year in operating expenses. Additionally, the data distribution, hardware and security costs per user, with exponential growth, are approximately fifty cents ($0.50) per active user per month. Therefore, a significant amount of reserve capital is required prior to launching Webtalk's entire product and service line to the public. The funds acquired from the campaign will be applied to the reserve capital required to sustain operations prior to and after a public launch.</p>
                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Webtalk Credits</h2>
                  <p>
                    Participants in the campaign may make contributions in $100 increments. In exchange for such contributions, participants will be awarded credits toward the purchase of Webtalk premium services following the launch of Webtalk. Credits are
                    <b>not refundable</b>
                    and must be applied to any of the following services after Webtalk's launch: iMeet virtual meeting service, Webtalk Pro exclusive feature subscriptions and/or premium phone and live chat support. Credits can also be applied towards the purchase of advertising on Webtalk upon launch. Credits do not expire and therefore can be held and applied to any future product offerings by Webtalk. No affiliate commissions are paid on Webtalk Credit purchases until they are applied to a Webtalk premium service as described below.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the event that Webtalk is unable to launch its full product offering by the announced deadline on Webtalk.co, Webtalk Credits awarded to participants in the campaign will be applied to the purchase of an iMeet Plus virtual meeting service for three months. For more details about the iMeet Plus service plan, please visit
                    <a href='http://iMeet.com'>http://iMeet.com.</a>
                    Webtalk is an official reseller for PGi’s iMeet virtual meeting services. Webtalk reserves the right to extend the announced deadline to launch all products until December 31, 2016. If the deadline is not fulfilled by the extended date, all Webtalk Credits awarded in exchange for each $100 contribution to the campaign will immediately be applied to three months of iMeet Plus service which shall be activated, and will have received activation notice, by no later than January 31st, 2017.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Referral Rewards</h2>
                  <p>In order to receive affiliate commissions from the sale of Webtalk services, an individual must enroll in Webtalk’s free SocialCPX affiliate referral program. The SocialCPX affiliate referral program is an entirely separate program from this campaign and there is no requirement that a participant in the campaign enroll as an affiliate and there is no requirement that an affiliate participate in the campaign. If an individual has enrolled in the SocialCPX affiliate referral program prior to the full product launch of Webtalks’s products, the commissions from such affiliate’s direct referrals to the campaign will be available upon the product launch and the application of Webtalk Credits to the purchase or premium Webtalk products. All indirect referrals (people referred by your affiliate referrals) through five referral levels fall under the Team Trainer terms and conditions of the affiliate referral program.</p>
                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Team Trainer</h2>
                  <p>
                    Any individual who enrolls in Webtalk’s free SocialCPX affiliate referral program is eligible to become a Team Trainer and earn commissions from indirect referrals (referrals of your referrals) through five referral levels. An affiliate will instantly be awarded the Team Trainer promotion once one of the affiliate’s direct referrals has purchased a Webtalk premium service; including but not limited to; iMeet virtual meetings, Webtalk Pro exclusive feature subscription and Premium phone and live chat support. Webtalk Credit received in exchange for contributions hereunder
                    <b>DO NOT QUALIFY</b>
                    for the Team Trainer promotion
                    <b>UNTIL</b>
                    they are applied towards the purchase of a Webtalk premium service. The one premium service sales quota requirement is an ongoing requirement through the entire enrollment period as a SocialCPX affiliate. An affiliate’s personal purchase of a Webtalk premium services
                    <b>DOES NOT</b>
                    qualify the affiliate for Team Trainer commissions. An annual premium service purchases by a direct referral will qualify an affiliate for Team Trainer commissions for a one year period. However, a single monthly service purchase must renew monthly to maintain Team Trainer qualifications. Affiliates must maintain one (1) active premium service direct referral customer to maintain Team Trainer qualifications.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Guidelines & Restrictions</h2>
                  <p>Direct referrals to qualify an affiliate for Team Trainer eligibility cannot be anyone residing within the affiliate’s household. Affiliates will be immediately terminated from the SocialCPX affiliate program if any the following conditions apply: an affiliate makes a purchase under another Webtalk user’s account to qualify for the Team Trainer promotion, an affiliate misrepresents the earning potential of Webtalk affiliate program, an affiliate misrepresents or defames any company brand, likeness or employee of Webtalk, Inc., or an affiliate violates any of Webtalk’s Terms, Conditions, Copyrights, Trademarks or Patents. All users agree that they will not attempt to de-engineer, reverse- engineer or attempt to gain unauthorized access to any of Webtalk’s internet products.</p>
                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Affiliate Commission Plan</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Affiliate Commission Plan and Team Trainer commissions are available only to those individuals who have enrolled in the SocialCPX affiliate referral program and have agreed to the terms and conditions of that program.
                    <b>By participating as a contributor to the campaign, you are not automatically an affiliate; if you wish to earn commissions, you must enroll in the SocialCPX affiliate referral program.</b>
                    Individuals who have enrolled as an affiliate will immediately begin earning a ten percent (10%) commission on all revenue generated from their direct referrals (following the launch of the Webtalk products and services). Once an affiliate has been awarded the Team Trainer designation, they are eligible to earn the same ten percent (10%) commission from all revenue generated by a five (5) level user referral network, which includes four (4) levels of indirect referrals plus direct referrals. Commissions paid on revenue share includes, but is not limited to; advertising sales, promotional offer purchases, premium service subscription, talent solutions, transactions fees and third party software application subscription and download fees. Commissions are paid on Webtalk’s gross revenue, not on gross sales, and therefore purchases made from third party providers will hold a much lower gross revenue total than the gross sales total (ie. Best Buy sells a game system for $200 on Webtalk and pays Webtalk $20 for the sale, only the $20 is commissionable to affiliates). Individual results will vary. Webtalk makes no guarantees on earnings.

                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>LIMITED PARTICIPANT COMMISSION PLAN OFFERING</h2>
                  <p>The five (5) level affiliate referral commission plan will only be available to the first one million (1,000,000) affiliates who reach six hundred dollars ($600) in earned commissions within a single calendar year. All qualified affiliate Team Trainers will earn from the five (5) level commission plan until the maximum number of affiliate participants has been reached.</p>
                  <p>At such time, all qualified affiliate Team Trainers who have reached six hundred dollars ($600) in earned commissions in a calendar year will be grandfathered into the the five (5) level compensation plan as long as they maintain their status as a qualified Team Trainer.</p>
                  <p>All other affiliates, and affiliate Team Trainers, will then be notified that their referral compensation plan will be changed to a three (3) level commission plan. The three (3) level referral commission plan will then be available to all affiliate Team Trainers until an additional two million (2,000,000) affiliate Team Trainers have reached six hundred dollars ($600) in earned commissions within a calendar year.</p>
                  <p>Once the maximum number of affiliates for the three (3) level commission plan has been reached, all other affiliates will then earn from a single level (direct referrals only) commission plan.</p>
                  <p>The multi-tiered commission plan was specifically designed to reward Webtalk’s early product adopters for helping the company grow and acquire a critical mass of users to make the community valuable for any user who joins, affiliate or not, paid user or not.</p>
                  <p>

                  <h2 class='modal-box__title'>Affiliate Income Hypothetical Disclaimer</h2>
                  <p>Any hypothetical examples of the income that may be earned under the SocialCPX affiliate referral program that you may have viewed and that was presented by Webtalk is intended to explain how the Webtalk Social CPX Compensation Plan works. As such, several assumptions are made in such hypothetical examples, which assumptions will probably not be true for your Webtalk Affiliate business if you enroll as an affiliate. Such hypothetical examples are not intended to be representative of the income, if any, that you can or will earn as an Affiliate. These figures should not be considered as guarantees or projections of your actual earnings or profits. Any guarantee of earnings, whether made by Webtalk or an Affiliate, would be misleading. Success as an Affiliate results only from successful sales efforts, which require hard work, diligence, and leadership.</p>
